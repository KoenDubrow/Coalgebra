# Coalgebra
Short introduction on coalgebra in system dynamics and data types

This is a report written as the final assesement piece for a reading course on category theory completed in the second year of my undergraduate degree. The course was done under the guidance of a faculty member at my university who also provided feedback on this report. It contains some novel work in proof detais and generalisation of proofs.
